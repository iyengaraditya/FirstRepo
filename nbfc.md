## Introduction
The RBI defines an NBFC as:
> A Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) is a company registered under the Companies Act, 1956 engaged in the business of loans
and advances, acquisition of shares/stocks/bonds/debentures/securities issued by Government or local authority or other marketable
securities of a like nature, leasing, hire-purchase, insurance business, chit business but does not include any institution whose
principal business is that of agriculture activity, industrial activity, purchase or sale of any goods (other than securities) or
providing any services and sale/purchase/construction of immovable property. A non-banking institution which is a company and has
principal business of receiving deposits under any scheme or arrangement in one lump sum or in instalments by way of contributions
or in any other manner is also a non-banking financial company (Residuary non-banking company).
  
In simple words, NBFCs are institutions which serve as an alternative to banks. They have fewer restrictions mandated by the RBI, but they also lack certain functions that banks can fulfil. Apart from the lack of functionality, NBFCs have certain advantages over traditional banks. NBFCs have less stringent requirements (for borrowers) to issue loans and also allow for later payment of the principal of a loan. So for small businesses, and individuals taking loans, NBFCs are much more convenient than banks. Particular sections of the society, primarily the economically weaker sections, for whom banks are perhaps unaffordable and inaccessible, rely solely on NBFCs to meet their credit requirements. These companies are the primary financers to those small and medium-sized businesses, whose growth is critical for the growth of the Indian economy.
